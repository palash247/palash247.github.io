In my early school days some questions where so commonly asked that the students used to remember answers like alphabets. One of them was

> Who is the first man to walk on moon?

I remember I used to answer it even before the question was completed. On 20th July, the day Apollo 11 landed on the moon, I asked myself

> Why do I remember only Neil Armstrong? Why not his other crew members? Why not the second and third person to walk on the moon?

So this is my quest to find out the reason behind this.

## The problem

My excessive obcession with who came first.
