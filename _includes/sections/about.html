<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I am a true believer in scientific methods.
    
    Coding has kept me connected with engineering and taught me how to become a better version of myself.
    
    I have pulled out countless night out until I solved the challenging task I stumbled upon.
    
    Sometimes, I get frustrated thinking about how badly we humans have screwed up the balance of mother nature.
