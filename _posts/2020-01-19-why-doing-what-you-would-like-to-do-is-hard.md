Let's just get one thing out of the way, I don't think we are going to discover the answer to the question. I just want write, may be we'll get our answers on the way.

I am an introvert, for me that means most of the time I am inside my head thinking about what I should do. Or drifting away in the intergalactic space wondering do we really have to leave the Earth someday. You must be thinking I am such a waste of time, cursing me, saying get up and husstle, life is to short to worry about anything other than the present. Belive me when I am saying, I tell same shit to myself all the time and I still end up only thinking about maintaining a daily journal and never writting a single line. 

I wonder why I am wired like this, I mean, you know packing your bag the day before the travel would definitely help you in not forgetting something, right? Then why do I always end up packing an hour before my train? Why is knowing something is good for you is'nt enough? Why my actions don't speak what I think? Is this how it is supposed be? 

I always feel there's this voice in my head which is always trying to tell me what's right for me and I don't hear. It is exactly like in the old cartoons, where our protagonist is having an imagenery conversation with a angel and demon contradicting each other. Only difference is my thoughts are constantly possesed by the angel and actions by the deamon.

I never had to argue with my parents for important decisions of my life. Their way of parenting is more like "make your own mistakes, and try not to repeat them". So, unlike most of my friends, all the important decisions are mine only. For example: Resigning from Accenture to join a small company without asking any kind of raise. I was so excited to work on Machine Learning project that the salary Gso I did'nt care acout
