In statistics, we like to summarize everything to a single number. Be it spread of the data, measure of central tendency or a 2d scatter plot. Because, few numbers are easier to analyse. Coefficient of correlation is one such number which summarizes scatter plot.

## Coefficient of Correlation - $r$

It is a number ranging from $-1$ to $1$ which determines the degree of linear relationship/correlation between two variables. In other words, it determines how well we can plot the data points generated by two variables on a single line. It can also tell us the slop of the line which can be fit to this data. Let's first try understand how to interpret the coefficient of correlation $r$.

Given two variables $x$ and $y$, there are three possibilities in terms of linear correlation.

1. When $y$ increases with $x$, *positive correlation*
2. When $y$ decreases with $x$, *negative correlation*
3. When $y$ does not change with respect to $x$, *no correlation*

You can see all three cases in the figure above. The figure shows scatter plot of points $(x,y)$ for three different condition. Notice, when the $y$ is increasing with $x$ the value of $r$ is positive and when it is decreasing with $x$ the value of $r$ is negative. Also, in figure with no correlation, you can not find any straight line which can summarize the trend in the data, making the value of $r$ zero.

If the value of $r$ was $1$, the conclusion would be, all the points in the scatter plot are on the same line which has a positive slop. If the value of $r$ is $-1$, all the points in the scatter plot are on the same line with negative slop. Values closer to 1 or $-1$ depicts a strong correlation. Whereas values, closer to 0, depicts a weak correlation.

## How to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient - $r$:

It is mean product of $z$-scores of the two variables. That means, calculate $z$-scores of the two variables, multiply theme element wise and take average of them.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}zx_i.zy_i
\end{aligned}
$$

Where,
$n$ = number of elements in the sample,
$zx_i$ = $z$-score of $i^{th}$ element of $x$:
$$ zx_i = \frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s_x}$$
$s_x$ being standard deviation of x
$zy_i$ = $z$-score of $i^{th}$ element of $y$:
$$ zy_i = \frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{s_y} $$
$s_y$ being standard deviation of y


You might be used to another version of the equation but I find the above one very easy to remember. Of course we can solve it to get the textbook version of the equation. Let's substitute values of $z$-scores $(zx_i, zy_i)$, means $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ and standard deviations $(s_x, s_y)$ in above equation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    r &=& \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{s_x.s_y} \\
    r &=& \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\frac{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}.\sqrt{\frac{(y_i-\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}} \\
    r &=& \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{(x_i-\bar{x})^2.(y_i-\bar{y})^2}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
